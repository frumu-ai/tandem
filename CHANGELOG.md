## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- Compact theme selector dropdown with theme details and color swatches.
- Active provider/model badge next to the tool selector in chat.
- Allow-all toggle for tool permissions on new chats.

### Fixed

- Linux `.deb` auto-update now downloads the `.deb` artifact (instead of the AppImage), preventing `update is not a valid deb package`.
- Taskbar no longer overlays the About and Settings screens.
- OpenCode sidecar API compatibility after upstream route changes (provider/model listing and prompt submission).
- Streaming event parsing for newer OpenCode SSE payload shapes.
- Structured provider errors now surface in the chat UI instead of failing silently; improved extraction of specific reasons (e.g., credit limits) from nested responses.
- Permission prompts now render correctly for updated tool event payloads.
- Provider key status refreshes immediately after saving or deleting API keys.
- Technical tool calls (edit, write, ls, etc.) are now handled as transient background tasks and auto-cleanup from chat on success.
- Final AI responses now render reliably at the end of a session, with an automatic backfill mechanism if the stream is interrupted.
- Reduced terminal log spam by downgrading verbose background activity and summarizing large event payloads.
- Fixed a TypeScript error where the `tool` property was missing from the `tool_end` event payload.
