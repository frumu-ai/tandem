# Recurring Locations: "The Startup"

## 1. The "Garage" (Main Office)
**Int/Ext:** INT
**Description:**
Not actually a garage, but a converted industrial warehouse space that they call "The Garage" to maintain street cred. Exposed brick, hastily run ethernet cables taped to the floor with gaffer tape, and an ungodly amount of empty LaCroix cans on every flat surface.
**Key Features:**
- **The "War Table"**: A ping-pong table that hasn't been used for ping-pong in months. Covered in laptops, coffee cups, and a tangle of chargers.
- **The Whiteboard Wall**: One entire wall painted with whiteboard paint. Currently covered in a chaotic mix of brilliant product roadmap ideas and indecipherable doodles.
- **The "Nap Pod"**: A beanbag chair in the corner with a hoodie thrown over it.

## 2. Java Crypt (The Coffee Shop)
**Int/Ext:** INT
**Description:**
The hipster coffee shop downstairs. It smells of roasted beans and pretension. The lighting is aggressively dim. The tables are reclaimed wood and wobble dangerously. This is where the "real" meetings happen away from the rest of the team.
**Key Features:**
- **The Corner Booth**: Semi-private, acoustically terrible.
- **The Counter**: Where the barista, CHAD (20s, aspiring tech-bro), judges everyone's orders.

## 3. The Server Room (The Closet)
**Int/Ext:** INT
**Description:**
A literal broom closet that houses the on-prem servers they are definitely supposed to have migrated to the cloud by now. It is hot, noisy, and cramped.
**Key Features:**
- **The Rack**: A messy server rack with blinking lights that occasionally turn ominous red.
- **The Janitor's Bucket**: Still in there, for some reason.

## 4. Roof Access
**Int/Ext:** EXT
**Description:**
The flat roof of the warehouse building. A place for smoking breaks, panic attacks, and dramatic celebratory yelling. Overlooks the city skyline (if you squint past the smog).
**Key Features:**
- **The AC Unit**: A loud, rattling industrial AC unit that necessitates shouting.
- **The Ledge**: A low brick wall, safe to lean on but feels precarious.
