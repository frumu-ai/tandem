# VPS Web Portal (Tandem Engine Examples)

This project contains a highly-polished, multi-page showcase that connects directly to the `tandem-engine` running as a headless server on a Linux VPS. It provides a secure UI wrapper and a Node/Express backend that handles reverse-proxying and authentication, safeguarding the engine's open ports from the public internet.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux VPS (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Node.js (v18+)
- PM2 (optional, for running the project in the background)
- The [Tandem Engine CLI](https://github.com/your-org/tandem)

## 1. Setup the Tandem Engine

First, install the tandem engine directly on your VPS. Provide it access to local AI providers or proxies as well as MCP components.

Generate a secure Server Token. Do NOT lose this.

```bash
tandem-engine token generate
```

_(Copy the generated UUID. We'll need it later)._

Start the headless engine running in the background. It will bind to `localhost:39731` by default.

```bash
nohup tandem-engine serve --headless &
```

_(Alternatively, run it using a robust service manager like SystemD)._

## 2. Setup the Web Portal

Clone this repository or copy the `vps-web-portal` directory to your VPS.

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd vps-web-portal
npm install
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root of the portal directory:

```env
# The port the Node/Express proxy will listen on (Publicly accessible)
PORT=80

# The Secret Key used to login to the secure Web Portal URL
VITE_PORTAL_KEY=my_secret_password_123

# The Token generated by 'tandem-engine token generate' in Step 1
VITE_ENGINE_TOKEN=your-generated-tandem-token-here

# (Optional) Engine local address
VITE_TANDEM_ENGINE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:39731
```

## 3. Build & Run

Build the Vite React frontend for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the Node.js Express server to host the application. We recommend using PM2 to keep the server alive forever:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "tandem-portal" -- run start:server
```

_(Alternatively, you can just run `npm run start:server` directly for testing)._

## Usage

Visit your server's public IP or Domain name in your browser (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:80`).
You will be greeted by the Login portal. Enter the `VITE_PORTAL_KEY` you configured earlier to unlock the dashboards.

### Included Dashboards

1. **Deep Research:** Unleash an agent to scour the public web and answer heavy research questions.
2. **Parallel Swarm:** Submit an idea and watch 3 distinct personas debate its merits simultaneously using the Parallel APIs.
3. **Interactive RPG:** An AI Text Adventure game demonstrating the `Questions API` over Streaming SSE.
4. **Second Brain:** Grant an agent local system context using Local MCP (Model Context Protocol).
5. **Connectors:** Setup Slack, Discord, or Telegram bots so your team can @ the engine directly.

## Security Note

**Never** expose port `39731` to `0.0.0.0` or disable the firewall on a public VPS. Only the Reverse Proxy (this portal) should converse with the background Tandem engine locally, proxying authenticated REST and SSE requests.
