# Image Requirements for PowerPoint Presentations

To successfully include images/screen grabs in your slide decks, please follow these guidelines:

## 1. Storage Location

Place all images in the `assets/` directory at the root of the project:
`C:\Users\evang\work\tandem\assets\`

## 2. File Formats

Supported formats:

- `.png` (Recommended for screen grabs)
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`

## 3. Naming Convention

Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with underscores (e.g., `dashboard_v1_main.png`).

## 4. Referencing in Chat

When you want an image on a slide, simply specify the filename:
_"Put assets/dashboard_v1_main.png on slide 4."_
