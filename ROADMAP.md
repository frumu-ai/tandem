# Tandem Roadmap (Next 3 Months)

## Month 1 — First outcome & onboarding

- Guided onboarding wizard (folder → provider → starter pack)
- Starter Packs UI (install + open + draft first prompt)
- Starter skills gallery (keep paste SKILL.md as Advanced)

## Month 2 — UX polish & discoverability

- Reduce jargon in UI labels and docs
- Improve “what happened” visibility (group tool activity, clearer statuses)
- Expand pack catalog and add “share/export” basics (local-only)

## Month 3 — Trust & hardening

- Track and resolve security backlog (asset protocol scope, CSP, path canonicalization)
- Improve CI confidence (tighten lint/clippy gradually)
- Better issue/PR hygiene for contributor scale
