# Release Notes

Canonical release notes live in `docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md`.

## v0.2.8 (2026-02-09)

- Support multiple custom OpenCode providers by name: Tandem now lets you select arbitrary providers from the sidecar catalog (not just the built-in list) and persists the selection for routing.

## v0.2.7 (2026-02-08)

- Fix OpenCode config writes so existing `opencode.json` is not deleted if replacement fails (Windows-safe).
- Reduce sidecar idle memory usage with Bun/JSC environment hints.

## v0.2.6 (2026-02-08)

- Fix macOS release builds by disabling signing/notarization by default (can be enabled via `MACOS_SIGNING_ENABLED=true`).

## v0.2.5 (2026-02-08)

- Re-cut release to ensure CI/release builds run with the corrected GitHub Actions workflow.

## v0.2.4 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Starter Pack installs failing in packaged builds (bundled resource path resolution).
- Fixed onboarding getting stuck for Custom providers (e.g. LM Studio) and bouncing users back to Settings.
- Added Vector DB stats + manual workspace indexing in Settings.
- Improved macOS release workflow with optional signing/notarization inputs and CI Gatekeeper verification.

## v0.2.3 (2026-02-08)

- Fixed Orchestration Mode creating endless new root chat sessions during execution.
