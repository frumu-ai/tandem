# Tandem Vision

Tandem’s mission is to bring “AI coworker” power to **everyone**, not just programmers.

## What we’re building

- A **local-first** AI workspace: your files stay on your machine.
- A **zero-trust** agent: every sensitive operation is gated by permissions.
- A **guided experience**: workflows feel like a product, not a terminal.

## Who it’s for (near term)

Solo knowledge workers:

- writers
- researchers
- operators / admins
- analysts

## What “success” feels like

In under 2 minutes, a first-time user can:

1. pick a folder
2. connect an AI provider (or local model)
3. run a starter workflow and see an output
